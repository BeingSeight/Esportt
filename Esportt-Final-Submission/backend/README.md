# Backend

This directory is included to meet the project's structural requirements.

The actual backend functionality is implemented using Next.js API Routes, which are located in the `/frontend/src/app/api/` directory as per Next.js conventions. Next.js provides a full-stack framework where the backend and frontend coexist within the same codebase.

## API Routes Location

All backend API endpoints can be found in:
- `/frontend/src/app/api/`

This includes routes for:
- User authentication and registration
- Lead qualification and management
- Player matching algorithms
- Tournament management
- Tutorial recommendations
- Analytics and metrics
- And more...

For development and deployment instructions, please refer to the main README in the `/frontend` directory.
